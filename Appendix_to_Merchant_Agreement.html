        <p>v) At the request of TWINT, myPOS can set individual conditions for the admission of the
            client from a risk sector or demand a security deposit from the client.</p>

        <p>vi) The Client is registered in the TWINT merchant portal which is subject to TWINT’s
            approval. Obtaining approval for registration shall be at TWINT’s sole discretion and
            myPOS shall not be held liable in the event that the Client has been denied registration
            in TWINT’s platform; </p>

        <p>vii) after being successfully registered in TWINT’s platform, the Client’s myPOS
            Terminal/s will be registered in the TWINT system. </p>
        
        <p>viii)The Client agrees to adhere to these Special Terms and Conditions for accepting
            payments in the Client’s myPOS Account through TWINT Payments, included herein
            below;</p>

        <p>1.3. The Client acknowledges and agrees that we shall have the right to terminate the provision
            of the TWINT Payments, partially or in its entirety if according to our sole discretion the Client no
            longer conforms to the requirements set out above, or in the event that TWINT instructs us
            explicitly to do so.</p>

        <p>1.4. In the event that the Client is eligible to receive access to the TWINT payment functionality
            and is successfully registered in the TWINT system, myPOS shall provide the Client with a static
            QR code which is stored locally on the myPOS terminal operated by the Client. </p>

        <h3>2. Accepting TWINT payments on myPOS terminals.</h3>

        <p>2.1. Subject to all applicable provisions for acquiring services specified in the Legal Agreement
            for myPOS Account, the Client shall have the option to accept TWINT as a means of payment in
            CHF currency and have its myPOS Account funded with the accepted TWINT Payments on the
            Client’s myPOS device. </p>

        <p>2.2. The Client acknowledges and accepts that when a customer of the Client (Payer), chooses
            TWINT Payments, the acceptance of payments shall be done with the help of the static QR code
            which shall be displayed on the screen of the myPOS device. To proceed with the payment
            transaction, the Payer needs to scan the QR code with their TWINT app. </p>

        <p>2.3. In order to successfully perform the processing of TWINT payments via the QR code on
            the myPOS device, the Client undertakes to ensure that the necessary communication network
            requirements have been established. To this end, the Client understands and agrees that the
            provision of the necessary capacities shall be the sole responsibility of the Client. </p>

        <p>2.4. The Client understands and agrees that when the Client selects the TWINT payment
            option on the Client’s myPOS device, a payment request is transmitted to TWINT, where the
            transaction data sent from the myPOS terminal is checked. In the event that the transaction is
            successful, the amount will be settled to the Client’s myPOS Account instantly, less any applicable
            fees or obligations due by the Client to us. We shall bear no responsibility in case a transfer has
            not been executed properly due to a reason that lies with TWINT and is outside our control.</p>

        <p>2.5. The TWINT Payments also provides the Client with the possibility to refund payments
            made by the Client’s customers via the TWINT payment solution. Similar to the process for
            accepting TWINT payments on myPOS terminals, the Payer will be required to scan the QR code
            displayed on the Client’s myPOS device using their TWINT App, in order to initiate the refund
            process. After the refund operation has been completed successfully, the Payer shall receive the
            relevant amounts in their TWINT account. We shall bear no responsibility in case a transfer has
            not been executed properly due to a reason that lies with TWINT and is outside our control.</p>

        <p>2.6. The Client acknowledges and agrees that the Client becomes liable for the full or partial
            amount of any payment which has been subject to the initiated refund process and that in such
            cases, we are entitled to withhold amounts to be paid to the Client or to debit amounts from the
            Client’s account, equal to the amounts which have been subject to refund. In such instances, the
            terms and conditions of the Merchant Agreement for myPOS Account shall apply</p>

        <h3>3. TWINT Acceptance Policy.</h3>

        <p>3.1. The Client understands and agrees that some categories of industries as specified by
            TWINT, are considered as “risk” industries, and in the event that the Client is affiliated to such a
            risk industry, the use of the TWINT payment solution by the Client on the Client’s myPOS device
            is subject to prior approval by TWINT. </p>

        <p>3.2. The Client understands and agrees that TWINT has prohibited some categories of
            industries and as a consequence, TWINT shall not accept myPOS Clients who are active in such
            categories.</p>

        <p>3.3. The Client understands and agrees that TWINT can conduct independent risk
            assessments and risk monitoring of onboarding the Clients and as a result, preserves the right to
            unilaterally reject the application of new Clients for the use of the TWINT service or terminate the
            service for already existing Clients, regardless of the risk class and category of the Clients’
            business activity</p>

        <p>3.4. The Client acknowledges that we shall not be liable to the Client in such instances where
            the Client has been denied access to the TWINT Payment or the Client has been subsequently
            suspended by TWINT to use TWINT Payments as a result of incompliance with TWINT’s
            acceptance policy, restrictions or risk management.</p>

        <p>3.5. For the purposes of these Special Terms and Conditions, the Client agrees and
            understands that the following activities shall be considered an abuse of TWINT Payments and
            shall result in the immediate suspension of the TWINT Payments on myPOS terminals:</p>

        <p>i) The Client breaches the terms and conditions of Appendix “TWINT Payments” or in
            case of breach of any other agreement concluded between us and the Client; </p>

        <p>ii) The Client accepts payments through improper use of TWINT Payments when the
            Client is aware of the irregularities in the execution of the said transactions; </p>

        <p>iii) In case of an irregular number of complaints or requests for chargebacks submitted
            by customers of the Client and/or in the event that TWINT transactions have been
            reported as fraudulent by third parties.</p>
